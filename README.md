## **Automated Tumor Segmentation in MRI Neuroimaging - From Advanced AI techniques to Clinical Toolbox**

This research proposal addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate tumor segmentation in neuroimaging, particularly utilizing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The project aims to develop a robust and automated approach for tumor delineation. The proposed methodology integrates state-of-the-art MRI neuroimaging techniques with advanced artificial learning methods.

The research plan involves acquiring and preprocessing a diverse dataset of MRI scans, encompassing various tumor types, sizes, and locations for automatic tumor segmentation. The core of the project lies in training and fine-tuning the developed model with AI using already segmented tumor dataset. Our approach will explore the integration of multi-modal MRI data, such as T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR images, to capture complementary information and improve segmentation accuracy Then, we will generalize the model across other patients'cohort and imaging protocols.

Finally, to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice, the project will include the development of a user-friendly clinical toolbox to integrate the automated tumor segmentation algorithm in real world clinical scenarios.
