TODO:
- uncertainty: how much the predictions differ from the ground truth 
- weight the different models when computing uncertainty
- we need to know whether one model is better for one tissue type than another (and modalities)
- read about how you could include the uncertainty 

DONE:
- convert the segmentations to nifti files 
- get matlab
